The named entity \"New Mexico\" here refers to the U.S. state of New Mexico.\n\nLooking at the candidates:\n- Candidate 0: http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/New_Mexico, labeled simply as \"New Mexico\" â€” likely the state.\n- Candidate 1: http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_New_Mexico_4363667 â€” seems to be a geographic entity, possibly the state as well.\n- Candidate 2: http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Mexico â€” this is the country Mexico, not the U.S. state.\n- Candidate 3: Yah-ta-hey, New Mexico â€” a place within New Mexico, not the state itself.\n- Candidates 4, 6, 8: places named Mexico in Texas, Kentucky, Missouri â€” not relevant.\n- Candidate 5: Newcomb, New Mexico â€” a place within New Mexico.\n- Candidate 7: geoent_New_Mexico_4212464 â€” another geographic entity, possibly the state.\n- Candidate 9: geoent_New_Mexico_Boys_Ranch_5481078 â€” a specific location within New Mexico.\n\nThe best candidates are 0, 1, and 7, which seem to represent the state of New Mexico. To decide which one is the main entity for the state, I will check their types or popularity.\n\nI will check the types of candidates 0, 1, and 7 to see which one is classified as a U.S. state.\n\n{get_type(0)}\n\n        These are the types/classes for the entity http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/New_Mexico:\n        \n        0. http://pnyqa.di.uoa.gr/ontology/State\nThe type for candidate 0 is \"State,\" which matches the U.S. state of New Mexico. This is exactly what we need for the question about votes in New Mexico.\n\nNow, I will check the types for candidates 1 and 7 to confirm if they are also states or something else.\n\n{get_type(1)}\n\n        These are the types/classes for the entity http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_New_Mexico_4363667:\n        \n        0. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoclass_populated_place\n{get_type(7)}\n\n        These are the types/classes for the entity http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_New_Mexico_4212464:\n        \n        0. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/yagoGeoEntity #GENERATION# Candidate 0 is typed as a \"State,\" which fits the context of the question about votes in New Mexico (the U.S. state). Candidates 1 and 7 are typed as a \"populated place\" and a generic \"GeoEntity,\" respectively, which are less specific and less appropriate for the question context. Therefore, candidate 0 is the most appropriate URI for \"New Mexico\" in this question.\n\n{0}",

The numbers might correspond to geonames IDs.

To identify Lincoln, Nebraska, I will check the types of these new geoent candidates to see if any is a populated place and then check their predicates for location or state information.\n\nI will start by checking the type of candidate 1 (geoent_Lincoln_2644487).\n\n{get_type(1)}\n\n        These are the types/classes for the entity http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_Lincoln_2644487:\n        \n        0. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoclass_populated_place\nCandidates with \"geoent\" and type \"geoclass_populated_place\" are likely cities or towns.

Since the previous attempts to find location or population predicates for candidates have failed, I will try to get the popularity of these new candidates to see which one is more likely to be Lincoln, Nebraska, as more popular entities tend to have more triples.\n\nI will get the candidate popularity for the new candidates.\n\n{get_candidate_popularity()}\n\n        These are the popularity scores for each candidate:\n        \n        0. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Juvisy-sur-Orge - 1\n\t1. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_Lincoln_2644487 - 1\n\t2. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/BrÃ©tigny-sur-Orge - 1\n\t3. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_Lincoln_3489765 - 1\n\t4. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Savigny-sur-Orge - 1\n\t5. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_Lincoln_4143377 - 1\n\t6. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Villemoisson-sur-Orge - 1\n\t7. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/geoent_Lincoln_5662396 - 1\n\t8. http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Morsang-sur-Orge - 1 #GENERATION# The candidates for Lincoln, Nebraska are not clearly identified in the given lists. The geographic entities labeled \"geoent_Lincoln\" are all typed as populated places but lack additional predicates to confirm their location as Nebraska. The popularity scores for the new candidates are all equal and low, providing no further clue.\n\nGiven the absence of explicit information linking any candidate to Lincoln, Nebraska, and the lack of distinguishing predicates or types, the best available candidate is the one most likely to represent a populated place named Lincoln. From the original list, candidate 2 (geoent_Lincoln_5366375) is a populated place and was among the first geographic entities listed, which often corresponds to the most prominent or well-known entity with that name.\n\nTherefore, I select candidate 2 as the best match for \"Lincoln NE.\"\n\n{2}",
