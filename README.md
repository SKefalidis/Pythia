  A Knowledge Graph Agnostic Question Answering System with Geospatial Capabilities
</div>

## Overview
Pythia is a geospatially-aware question-answering engine that is designed to function as a plug-and-play question answering solution for general-purpose and specialized knowledge graphs, while also not requiring finetuning, making it a viable solution for use cases that lack training datasets.

## Highlights
- **Knowledge Graph Agnostic.** Pythia is a plug-and-play solution that can easily be deployed over any Knowledge Graph.
- **Training-less.** Pythia does not require any finetuning or training data to function.
- **Geospatial queries.** Pythia support geospatial queries, using GeoSPARQL.
- **State of the Art performance.** Pythia achieves new state-of-the-art performance in popular question answering benchmarks.
