  A Knowledge Graph Agnostic Question Answering System with Geospatial Capabilities
</div>

## Overview
Pythia is a geospatially-aware question-answering engine that is designed to function as a plug-and-play question answering solution for general-purpose and specialized knowledge graphs, while also not requiring finetuning, making it a viable solution for use cases that lack training datasets.

## Highlights
- **Knowledge Graph Agnostic.** Pythia is a plug-and-play solution that can easily be deployed over any Knowledge Graph.
- **Training-less.** Pythia does not require any finetuning or training data to function.
- **Geospatial queries.** Pythia support geospatial queries, using GeoSPARQL.
- **State of the Art performance.** Pythia achieves new state-of-the-art performance in popular question answering benchmarks.

## Getting Started

### Repository structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `datasets/` contains the QA datasets used in the evaluation of Pythia
- `logs-and-results/` contains the log files and raw results of the evaluation of Pythia
- `neuralqa/` contains the source code of Pythia and auxiliary linkers
- `tools/` contains helper tools for creating indices, ontology graphs and query manipulation

### How to run
